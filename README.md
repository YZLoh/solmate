# SolMate

A blockchain project for Solana's Summer Camp 2022 Hackathon. This project serves as a proof of concept to bring extra use cases to existing NFTs in Token Gating and Evolving NFTs.

We created an simple web application to showcase this concept. Do check it out [here](https://app.netlify.com/sites/solmate/overview)!

# Usage
Our web app demonstrates the typical user flow as a proof of concept. The user flow is as follows:

1. The user is introduced to the app in our getting started screens
2. The user connects his/her wallet
3. Users are introduced to existing NFTs in their wallet
4. On clicking the QR Code icon at the top right, users are rouoted to the screen containing a QR Code associated with their wallet
5. On verification of this QR Code, a signal is given to both the user and the verifier that the user indeed has the NFT ticket and would be allowed into the venue
6. Behind the scenes, the NFT's counter increases and evolves when the condition stipulated by the organiser is met

The end product is a token gating solution with NFTs that induces customer loyalty through inherent rewards by participating in more events.

# The BUIDLERS
Brought together through fate at one of Solana Summer Camp 2022's workshops, we are a team of young builders and strategists hacking away at a key we believe brands, event organizers, developers, and artists can utilize to engage their community with.
